Mann-Whitney U Test (DRTAG's Binary Weighting scores are better than Autogen's Binary Weighting scores): H=897.500, p=0.0000
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated by newly created agents in DRTAG contains more keywords relavant to the scenario than discussions generated by newly created agents in Autogen.

Mann-Whitney U Test (IAAG's Binary Weighting scores are better than Autogen's Binary Weighting scores): H=846.000, p=0.0000
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated by newly created agents in IAAG contains more keywords relavant to the scenario than discussions generated by newly created agents in Autogen.

Mann-Whitney U Test (DRTAG's Binary Weighting scores are better than IAAG's Binary Weighting scores): H=597.500, p=0.0147
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated by newly created agents in DRTAG contains more keywords relavant to the scenario than discussions generated by newly created agents in IAAG.
