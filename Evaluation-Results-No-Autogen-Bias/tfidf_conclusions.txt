Mann-Whitney U Test (DRTAG's TF-IDF scores are better than Autogen's TF-IDF scores): H=892.000, p=0.0000
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated using DRTAG has utilized domain-specific terminologies more than discussions generated using Autogen.

Mann-Whitney U Test (IAAG's TF-IDF scores are better than Autogen's TF-IDF scores): H=860.000, p=0.0000
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated using IAAG has utilized domain-specific terminologies more than discussions generated using Autogen.

Mann-Whitney U Test (DRTAG's TF-IDF scores are better than IAAG's TF-IDF scores): H=567.000, p=0.0425
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated using DRTAG has utilized domain-specific terminologies more than discussions generated using IAAG.
