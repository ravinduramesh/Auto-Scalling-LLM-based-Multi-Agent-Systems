It's crucial to have this evaluated promptly. I recommend you visit an emergency room or consult with your healthcare provider as soon as possible for a thorough examination and possibly imaging tests to identify the cause and start appropriate treatment. In the meantime, avoid eating heavy meals and stay hydrated but don't consume any painkillers unless advised by a physician, as they can mask symptoms needed for diagnosis."

In terms of lifestyle, gradually introduce a balanced diet and stay hydrated, which can support recovery. Regular, gentle exercise like walking can be beneficial once you're advised it's safe. To prevent future episodes, maintain a balanced diet with plenty of fiber, and consider regular check-ups to catch any potential issues early. Always follow prescribed medication directions precisely and consult your doctor before making any changes. If you're prescribed antibiotics, complete the full course, and never skip doses."
