If it\u2019s an acute pain, it could be due to various reasons, including appendicitis, especially if accompanied by symptoms like fever, nausea, or vomiting. Meanwhile, try to avoid eating or drinking much until evaluated. For future preventive care, maintain a balanced diet with fiber, stay hydrated, and engage in regular physical activity to support overall gastrointestinal health.
