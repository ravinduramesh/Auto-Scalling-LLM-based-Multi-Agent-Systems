Stay hydrated but avoid solid foods if you're feeling nauseous. Keep track of any additional symptoms and seek immediate care if the pain intensifies, or if you experience vomiting or a fever. For long-term health, consider regular check-ups and a balanced diet rich in fiber to maintain digestive health."
