It's important to contact your healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms, as pain in the right lower abdomen can have various causes, such as appendicitis, ovarian cysts, or gastrointestinal issues. In the meantime, try to rest and avoid taking any medications until you've consulted with a professional, as some medications could potentially mask symptoms or worsen the condition. \n\nStay hydrated, eat light, and maintain a comfortable position that minimizes pain. If the pain worsens or you develop a fever, nausea, or vomiting, seek medical attention immediately. Remember, self-diagnosis can be risky, and professional evaluation is crucial for appropriate treatment."
