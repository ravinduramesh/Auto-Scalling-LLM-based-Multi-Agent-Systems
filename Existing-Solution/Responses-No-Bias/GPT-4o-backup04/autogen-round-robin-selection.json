It's important to assess the intensity and duration of the pain, along with any other symptoms like fever, nausea, or changes in bowel habits. I recommend that you seek immediate medical attention to properly evaluate your situation, as conditions like appendicitis may require urgent care.

You can sip clear fluids like water or herbal tea if you're thirsty.
