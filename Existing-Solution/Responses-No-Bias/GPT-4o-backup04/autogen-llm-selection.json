Pain in the lower right abdomen could be due to several causes, such as appendicitis, a urinary tract infection, or a gastrointestinal issue. Given the location and severity, it's important to have this evaluated promptly.

Avoid taking painkillers unless prescribed, as they might mask symptoms and delay a proper diagnosis. For future prevention, consider incorporating a balanced diet high in fiber, ensuring adequate hydration, and engaging in regular physical activity to promote digestive health. Remember also to notice if certain foods or activities trigger similar discomfort and discuss them with your healthcare provider during your visit."
