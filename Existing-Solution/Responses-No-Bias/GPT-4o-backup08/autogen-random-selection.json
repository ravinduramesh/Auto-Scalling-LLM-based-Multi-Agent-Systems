While I'm here to provide information, I recommend you contact a doctor or visit the emergency room as soon as possible because this symptom could potentially indicate appendicitis or another urgent issue. \n\nUntil you can see a healthcare provider, avoid consuming food or drink, as you may need a medical evaluation or treatment that requires an empty stomach. Rest and avoid any strenuous activities. If you have any current medications, refrain from taking painkillers like ibuprofen, as they can sometimes complicate diagnosis.\n\nStay calm and communicate any additional symptoms to your healthcare provider, such as fever, vomiting, or changes in bowel movements. Your quick action is important."
