Once a diagnosis is made and a treatment plan is in place, ensure you follow all post-treatment care instructions. \n\nFor instance, stay hydrated, follow any prescribed dietary restrictions, and take medications as directed by your healthcare provider.

Incorporating light physical activities gradually can promote healing.\n\nTo prevent future issues, consider a balanced diet rich in fiber, maintain a healthy weight, and drink plenty of water throughout the day. Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider are advisable to keep track of your overall health and catch any potential issues early on.
