A thorough pre-operative assessment also involves evaluating your cardiovascular and respiratory systems to anticipate any specific needs during the procedure.\n\n2. **Anesthesia Options:**\n   - For appendectomies or similar abdominal surgeries, general anesthesia is typically used, meaning you'll be completely asleep and unaware during the procedure. This approach provides comprehensive pain relief and muscle relaxation, allowing the surgical team to perform the operation efficiently and safely.\n\n3. **Monitoring During Surgery:**\n   - Throughout the surgery, you'll be closely monitored. This includes tracking vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels, ensuring your body responds well to anesthesia, and adapting care based on your needs.\n\n4. **Post-operative Pain Management:**\n   - After surgery, our focus shifts to managing any discomfort effectively.
