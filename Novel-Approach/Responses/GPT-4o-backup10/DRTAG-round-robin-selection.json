This can often be done laparoscopically, using small incisions and a camera, which usually results in a quicker recovery and less scarring compared to open surgery. However, if the appendix has ruptured, an open surgery might be necessary to clean out the abdominal cavity. The risks of surgery can include infection, bleeding, or complications from anesthesia, but these are generally low, especially with laparoscopic procedures. Post-operatively, you\u2019ll need to limit physical activities for a short period and follow the dietitian's guidance on diet to prevent complications like constipation.

Pre-operatively, you'll be advised to fast\u2014usually no food or drink past midnight before surgery\u2014to reduce the risk of aspiration during anesthesia. While anesthesia-related complications are rare, potential risks include allergic reactions, breathing difficulties, or postoperative nausea and vomiting. After surgery, you'll be gradually awakened in the recovery room, where we will monitor your vital signs to ensure a smooth transition. Post-anesthesia recovery involves assessing your alertness, breathing effectively, and pain management before you're fully awakened and discharged from the post-anesthesia care unit.

I recommend discussing this possibility with the emergency team, as a urinalysis could uncover signs of hematuria indicative of a stone. If necessary, a CT scan of the abdomen can also help identify urological causes. Should a kidney stone be present, treatment may involve pain management, hydration to facilitate passage if the stone is small, or surgical interventions like lithotripsy for larger stones.
