Another potential diagnosis is a kidney stone, which often requires imaging for confirmation\u2014non-contrast CT is preferred for diagnosis. Hydration is key, but avoid consuming large amounts until a definitive diagnosis as recommended by the surgeon and radiologist. Additional diagnostic modalities may include ultrasound if gynecological issues such as ovarian cysts or ectopic pregnancy are suspected, especially if the patient is female.

Blood tests can also be useful in determining infection or inflammation markers. If gastrointestinal issues are confirmed, anti-inflammatory medications, antibiotics, or even surgical interventions may be warranted depending on the diagnosis. Ensure that you have a full workup, including evaluations by a gastroenterologist if initial findings are ambiguous or inconclusive. Early intervention is key to preventing complications and ensuring effective treatment."
