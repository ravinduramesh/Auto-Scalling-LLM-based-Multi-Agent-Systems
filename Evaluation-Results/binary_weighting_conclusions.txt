Test whether DRTAG's Binary Weighting scores are better than Autogen's Binary Weighting scores
Mann-Whitney U Test: H=855.000, p=0.0000
Cliff's Delta: 0.900 (large)
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated by newly created agents in DRTAG contains more keywords relavant to the scenario than discussions generated by newly created agents in Autogen.

Test whether IAAG's Binary Weighting scores are better than Autogen's Binary Weighting scores
Mann-Whitney U Test: H=727.500, p=0.0000
Cliff's Delta: 0.617 (large)
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated by newly created agents in IAAG contains more keywords relavant to the scenario than discussions generated by newly created agents in Autogen.

Test whether DRTAG's Binary Weighting scores are better than IAAG's Binary Weighting scores
Mann-Whitney U Test: H=597.500, p=0.0147
Cliff's Delta: 0.328 (small)
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated by newly created agents in DRTAG contains more keywords relavant to the scenario than discussions generated by newly created agents in IAAG.
