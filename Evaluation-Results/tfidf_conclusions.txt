Mann-Whitney U Test (DRTAG's TF-IDF scores are better than Autogen's TF-IDF scores): H=818.000, p=0.0000
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated using DRTAG has utilized domain-specific terminologies more than discussions generated using Autogen.

Mann-Whitney U Test (IAAG's TF-IDF scores are better than Autogen's TF-IDF scores): H=712.000, p=0.0001
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated using IAAG has utilized domain-specific terminologies more than discussions generated using Autogen.

Mann-Whitney U Test (DRTAG's TF-IDF scores are better than IAAG's TF-IDF scores): H=577.000, p=0.0307
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated using DRTAG has utilized domain-specific terminologies more than discussions generated using IAAG.
