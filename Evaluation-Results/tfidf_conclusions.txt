DRTAG's TF-IDF scores are better than Autogen's TF-IDF scores
Mann-Whitney U Test: H=818.000, p=0.0000
Cliff's Delta: 0.818 (large)
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated using DRTAG has utilized domain-specific terminologies more than discussions generated using Autogen.

IAAG's TF-IDF scores are better than Autogen's TF-IDF scores
Mann-Whitney U Test: H=712.000, p=0.0001
Cliff's Delta: 0.582 (large)
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated using IAAG has utilized domain-specific terminologies more than discussions generated using Autogen.

DRTAG's TF-IDF scores are better than IAAG's TF-IDF scores
Mann-Whitney U Test: H=577.000, p=0.0307
Cliff's Delta: 0.282 (small)
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis. There is statistically significant evidence to conclude that discussions generated using DRTAG has utilized domain-specific terminologies more than discussions generated using IAAG.
