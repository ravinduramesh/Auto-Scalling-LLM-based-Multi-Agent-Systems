Appendicitis typically requires an appendectomy to prevent complications like rupture, which could lead to severe infection or peritonitis. If surgery is confirmed necessary, it can usually be performed laparoscopically, which involves smaller incisions and quicker recovery. In the meantime, avoid eating or drinking as it might delay potential surgery. Stay prepared for possible rapid escalation to the operating room if imaging confirms appendicitis or another urgent condition. Rest assured, we\u2019ll manage your pain and symptoms throughout the diagnostic and treatment process."
