A detailed medical history and physical examination, along with blood tests, stool tests, and possibly an endoscopic evaluation, may be necessary to rule out these conditions. Immediate medical attention is crucial to diagnose the issue properly. Once in the emergency room, ensure that the healthcare providers are aware of any digestive symptoms you might have experienced, such as changes in bowel habits, fever, or previous episodes of abdominal pain. Quick and accurate assessment will guide the appropriate treatment, whether it\u2019s surgical, medical, or a combination of both."
