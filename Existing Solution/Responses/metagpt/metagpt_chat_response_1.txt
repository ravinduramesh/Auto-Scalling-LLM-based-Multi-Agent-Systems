As the Radiologist overseeing your care, I will be focusing on the imaging studies mentioned by Doctor. In your case, given the symptoms of sharp pain in the right lower side of your abdomen, an imaging study like a CT scan will be particularly valuable in providing detailed images of your abdominal area.

A CT scan can help us visualize the structures inside your abdomen, including your appendix, intestines, and other organs, to identify any potential causes of your discomfort. It allows us to see if there are any signs of inflammation, infection, or other abnormalities that may be contributing to your symptoms.

Once the CT scan is completed, I will carefully analyze the images to look for any abnormalities that could explain your symptoms. This information will be crucial in conjunction with the other tests and assessments to reach a definitive diagnosis and determine the most appropriate treatment plan for you.
